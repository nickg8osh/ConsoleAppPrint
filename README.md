# ConsoleAppPrint
A CAD package with no UI. 

    I want to markout 8 drill holes.

    this is a NON UI drill drawing print - Poor manâ€™s CAD!
    Why? I have a trusty laser printer - great for printing out arcane invoices for accountants that like paper copies.
    But it's dimensionally not so good. Aspect ratio is out - so I cannot use a CAD package to scale
    
    This is a "hack it and bash it" so I've got something to use!
